# Title: Setup project structure and base HTML
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the initial project structure with HTML5 boilerplate, CSS file, and JavaScript files
# Details:
Set up the basic project structure with index.html containing the split-pane layout, styles.css for styling, markdown-parser.js for the parser logic, and app.js for application logic. Include proper meta tags, responsive viewport settings, and semantic HTML structure.

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing: Verify HTML loads correctly, CSS and JS files are linked properly, and the basic layout renders in different browsers
